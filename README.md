# SparkFun SerLCD Library for STM32

## Important, important, important!

This library was moved to https://gitlab.gwdg.de/mario.hesse/sparkfun-serlcd-library-for-stm32. Here you can only see the old version from 12/10/202020.


## Fork from SparkFun

This is a fork of the [ SparkFun SerLCD Library](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_SerLCD_Arduino_Library). In this version it is optimized for STM32 mikrocontrollers by using the STM32 HAL library. Have fun with this library, improve and share it!

## General information

The SparkFun SerLCD is an AVR-based, serial enabled LCD that provides a simple and cost effective solution for adding a 20x4 Black on RGB Liquid Crystal Display into your project. We’ve overhauled the design to include an ATmega328P that handles all of the screen control, meaning a backpack is no longer needed! This display can now accept three different types of communication protocols: serial, I2C, and SPI. This simplifies the number of wires needed and allows your project to display all kinds of text and numbers.

The SerLCD is Qwiic compatible! We recommend adding a [Qwiic Adapter](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14495) to the back of the SerLCD to get it onto the Qwiic bus.

The on-board ATmega328P AVR microcontroller utilizes 11.0592 MHz crystal for greater communication accuracy with adjustable baud rates of 1200 through 1000000 but is default set at 9600. The firmware for this SerLCD is fully opensource and allows for any customizations you may need.
